Define the criteria: The first step is to define the criteria that will be used to evaluate the options in the Pugh Matrix. These criteria should be relevant, objective, and free from bias. They should also be specific and measurable.

Input the data: Once the criteria have been defined, the next step is to input the data for each option. This data should include the strengths and weaknesses of each option in relation to the defined criteria.

Develop the algorithm: The next step is to develop the algorithm that will be used to evaluate each option. This algorithm should take into account the strengths and weaknesses of each option and assign a score based on the criteria defined.

Program the model: Once the algorithm has been developed, the next step is to program the model using a suitable programming language. This could be a high-level language such as Python or a lower-level language such as C++.

Test the model: After the model has been programmed, it is important to test it to ensure that it is working correctly and producing the expected results. This may involve testing the model with different data sets and adjusting the algorithm as needed.

Implement the model: Once the model has been tested and refined, it can be implemented in the organization and used to evaluate the options in the Pugh Matrix.

In conclusion, building a computer model to evaluate the Pugh Matrix requires careful planning and a structured approach to ensure that the model is accurate, reliable, and free from bias.

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Convergent and divergent decision making are two distinct approaches to problem solving and decision making.

Convergent decision making is a process in which individuals or organizations focus on finding a single, optimal solution to a problem. This approach is often used in situations where the problem and its solution are well-defined and there is a clear right or wrong answer. Convergent decision making is focused on finding the best solution as quickly as possible and often involves a step-by-step process of evaluating and eliminating options until the best solution is found.

Divergent decision making, on the other hand, is a process in which individuals or organizations focus on generating a wide range of possible solutions to a problem. This approach is often used in situations where the problem is complex and there is no clear right or wrong answer. Divergent decision making is focused on generating as many potential solutions as possible, encouraging creativity and innovation. This process helps organizations to explore new ideas and find unexpected solutions to complex problems.

In conclusion, convergent and divergent decision making are two distinct approaches to problem solving and decision making, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. The best approach to use depends on the specific problem and the desired outcome. In some situations, a combination of both approaches may be used to find the best solution.

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Systems thinking is an approach to problem-solving that focuses on understanding how different parts of a system are interconnected and how they influence one another. It involves looking at a problem or situation holistically, rather than focusing on individual parts in isolation.

Systems thinking recognizes that complex systems, whether they are natural or man-made, are made up of many different elements that are interdependent and interact with each other in complex ways. By taking a systems thinking approach, you can gain a deeper understanding of these interrelationships and identify the underlying causes of problems, rather than just treating the symptoms.

Systems thinking can be applied in a variety of fields, from engineering and design to business management and public policy. It often involves the use of diagrams or models to visualize the different components of a system and how they are connected, and can help identify feedback loops, delays, and other dynamic relationships that are not immediately apparent.

Overall, systems thinking is a powerful tool for understanding complex problems and finding effective solutions that address the root causes, rather than just the symptoms.

<h4 id="what-is-emergence-in-system-thinking">what is emergence in system thinking<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-emergence-in-system-thinking" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>In the context of systems thinking, emergence refers to the appearance of unexpected properties or behaviors that arise from the interactions between the components of a system. These emergent properties cannot be predicted or explained by looking at the individual parts of the system in isolation.

When a system is composed of many interconnected components, these components interact with each other in complex ways that can give rise to emergent properties that are not present in any one component. These emergent properties may be beneficial or detrimental, depending on the context of the system and the goals of the stakeholders involved.

For example, the emergence of flocking behavior in birds is an example of an emergent property that arises from the interactions between individual birds. Flocking behavior is not present in any one bird, but emerges from the collective behavior of the flock as a whole. Similarly, the emergence of traffic jams on a highway is an example of an emergent property that arises from the interactions between individual cars.

Understanding the emergent properties of a system is important for designing and managing complex systems. By taking a systems thinking approach, you can identify the interactions between components that give rise to emergent properties, and design interventions that can leverage or mitigate those properties as needed.

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Key Takeaways - The four types of emergence are as follows:

Emergence of function — the system does something that was never done before 
Emergence of performance —the system does something better than before
Emergence of the ilities or nonfunctional attributes — the system has more reliability
Emergence of an emergency that we don’t want to happen

In the context of software engineering, emergence can also be categorized into three types based on their relationship to system function, performance, and non-functional attributes:

Functional Emergence: Functional emergence refers to the appearance of new or unexpected system behavior that affects system function. This type of emergence can be positive or negative, depending on whether the new behavior aligns with the intended system function.

Performance Emergence: Performance emergence refers to the appearance of new or unexpected system behavior that affects system performance. This type of emergence can be positive or negative, depending on whether the new behavior improves or degrades system performance.

Non-Functional Emergence: Non-functional emergence refers to the appearance of new or unexpected system behavior that affects non-functional attributes of the system, such as security, reliability, or maintainability. This type of emergence can be positive or negative, depending on whether the new behavior improves or degrades these non-functional attributes.

All three types of emergence are important to consider in software engineering, as they can impact the quality, reliability, and usability of software systems. By taking a systems thinking approach, software engineers can better understand and manage the emergent properties of their systems, and design more effective and robust software solutions.

Adding emergency to the concept of emergence in software engineering would generally refer to the appearance of new or unexpected system behavior that poses an urgent threat to the system or its users. In this case, the emergent property is not just unexpected, but also has the potential to cause harm or damage to the system or its users.

Emergency emergence can arise from a variety of factors, such as security vulnerabilities, hardware or software failures, or unexpected user behavior. For example, an emergency emergence might occur if a security breach exposes sensitive user data or if a software bug causes the system to crash or lose data.

Managing emergency emergence requires a rapid and coordinated response that focuses on identifying and mitigating the immediate threat to the system or its users. This may involve implementing emergency fixes, rolling back changes, or temporarily shutting down the system to prevent further damage.

By considering the possibility of emergency emergence in software systems, developers and system administrators can be better prepared to respond quickly and effectively in the event of a crisis. This can help minimize the damage caused by emergent properties and reduce the risk of harm to the system or its users.

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>The first task of systems thinking is to identify the system, its form, and its function. This involves understanding what the system is, how it is structured, and what it is intended to do.

Identifying the system involves defining the boundaries of the system and determining which components are included within those boundaries. For example, if you are studying a city as a system, you would need to determine what geographic area is included within the boundaries of the city and which elements of the city (such as buildings, roads, and people) are included in your analysis.

Identifying the form of the system involves understanding how the components of the system are structured and how they relate to one another. This might involve creating a system map or diagram that shows the different components of the system and how they are connected.

Identifying the function of the system involves understanding what the system is intended to do and how it achieves its goals. This might involve looking at the inputs and outputs of the system, as well as the processes that occur within the system.

By identifying the system, its form, and its function, systems thinkers can gain a deeper understanding of the underlying structure and dynamics of the system. This can help them identify opportunities for improvement, anticipate potential problems, and design interventions that can help the system achieve its goals more effectively.

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Abstraction is a key concept in systems thinking and involves simplifying complex systems by focusing on the most important or relevant elements. Abstraction can be used to help us understand the underlying structure and dynamics of a system, by focusing on the key components and relationships that drive the behavior of the system.

In systems thinking, abstraction is often used to create models or diagrams that represent the essential components of a system and how they interact. These models can help us understand the system more clearly and identify patterns and relationships that might not be immediately apparent.

For example, if we are studying a city as a system, we might create a map that shows the key components of the city (such as streets, buildings, and parks) and how they are connected. This abstraction can help us understand how the city functions as a system and identify opportunities for improvement or intervention.

However, it&#39;s important to recognize that abstraction is a simplification of reality, and that there may be important details or nuances that are left out of an abstract model. Therefore, it&#39;s important to use abstraction judiciously and to be aware of its limitations.

Overall, abstraction is a powerful tool for understanding complex systems and identifying the key components and relationships that drive their behavior. When used appropriately, abstraction can help us make sense of complex phenomena and design effective interventions that can improve the performance of a system.

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>The statement &quot;A system can be decomposed into entities, and entities can be composed into a system&quot; highlights the idea that systems and their components (entities) can be analyzed and understood at multiple levels of abstraction. This allows us to break down complex systems into more manageable parts and study them in greater detail, or to assemble smaller components into larger systems with more complex behavior.

Decomposition involves breaking a system down into its component parts or entities, in order to understand how the system works and how its behavior arises from the interactions between its components. This can be a powerful tool for managing complex systems, as it allows us to identify specific components that may be causing problems or that could be improved.

Composition involves combining smaller entities into a larger system, in order to create a more complex behavior that is not present in any one entity. This can be a powerful tool for designing new systems or improving the performance of existing ones, by leveraging the strengths of different entities and creating new emergent properties.

The idea that every system is part of a larger system and can be decomposed into smaller systems emphasizes the nested nature of systems, with each level of the hierarchy containing smaller subsystems that interact with one another. This can help us understand how the behavior of a system at one level of the hierarchy is influenced by the behavior of the subsystems at lower levels, and how changes at one level can propagate through the system as a whole.

Finally, the idea that systems and entities can be placed in a hierarchy based on issues of form or function highlights the idea that there are many different ways to break down and understand complex systems. By organizing systems and entities into a hierarchy, we can more easily understand how they relate to one another and how they can be managed effectively.

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Identify the entities by decomposition or composition: This means that you can break down a system into smaller components (decomposition) or combine smaller components into a larger system (composition) in order to understand the system better. For example, if you were trying to understand a computer system, you might decompose it into its hardware and software components, or you might compose a set of smaller applications into a larger suite of software.

Try to limit the number of entities to 7 +/- 2: This guideline is based on research in cognitive psychology, which suggests that the human brain can only hold a limited number of items in short-term memory. By limiting the number of entities to 7 +/- 2, you can make it easier to remember and manage the components of a system.

Use holistic thinking to identify all reasonable entities of a system: Holistic thinking involves looking at a system as a whole, rather than just focusing on its individual components. By using holistic thinking, you can identify all the entities of a system that are necessary to understand its behavior, rather than just focusing on a subset of the components.

Focus on the minimum set of essential entities: This means identifying the key components of a system that are necessary to understand its behavior, without including any unnecessary or extraneous entities. By focusing on the minimum set of essential entities, you can make it easier to understand and manage the system.

Draw a boundary that divides the system from its context: This involves defining the boundary of a system, and separating it from its larger context. By drawing a clear boundary, you can make it easier to understand the behavior of the system, without being distracted by external factors that are not directly related to the system.

Overall, these guidelines can be useful for identifying the key entities of a system and understanding how they interact with one another. By breaking a system down into smaller components, focusing on the essential entities, and using holistic thinking, you can gain a deeper understanding of the system and make it easier to manage effectively.

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>The statement &quot;A system can be decomposed into entities, and entities can be composed into a system&quot; highlights the idea that systems and their components (entities) can be analyzed and understood at multiple levels of abstraction. This allows us to break down complex systems into more manageable parts and study them in greater detail, or to assemble smaller components into larger systems with more complex behavior.

The first point you mentioned is that a group of entities becomes a system when there are relationships between them. This is because the behavior of a system arises from the interactions and relationships between its components.

The second point is that relationships have both form and function. The form of a relationship refers to how the components are connected or related to one another, while the function of a relationship refers to what that relationship is supposed to achieve or accomplish within the system.

The third point is that functional relationships are interactions, meaning that one entity affects another and some kind of operand (data, energy, or other resources) is either passed or shared between them. These interactions can be direct, such as when two entities physically touch or communicate with each other, or indirect, such as when one entity affects the environment and another entity is affected by that change.

The fourth point is that functional relationships can exist within the system, between the entities within the system, or between the entities in the system and entities outside of the system in the context. This is because a system is not an isolated entity, but is embedded within a larger context that can influence its behavior.

Overall, these points emphasize the importance of understanding the relationships between the entities in a system, and how those relationships give rise to emergent properties and behaviors. By understanding the functional relationships within a system, systems thinkers can identify opportunities for improvement, anticipate potential problems, and design interventions that can help the system achieve its goals more effectively.

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Sure, here’s a more detailed explanation of each of those points:

Think about a system as form and function – form is what the system is, the function is what it does: This means that when we’re analyzing a system, we should understand both its structure (the physical components, entities, and relationships) as well as its purpose (what it’s designed to achieve or do).

Think about the entities of the system – they have a form that enables their function: In any system, there are different entities (components or actors) that have specific roles and functions. To understand how the system works, it’s important to analyze each of these entities, their properties, and how they interact with other entities.

Think about the relationships – the structure that enables the interactions: The relationships between the entities in a system are what enable them to work together towards a common goal. Analyzing these relationships (how they’re structured, how information or resources flow, etc.) is key to understanding how the system functions.

Understand how the functions of entities interact to produce emergence and value: Emergence refers to the idea that a system can produce outcomes or properties that aren’t inherent in any individual entity or component. By understanding how the entities and relationships in a system work together, we can identify emergent properties and behaviors that can add value or create problems.

By approaching systems thinking in this way, we can break down complex systems into their component parts, analyze how those parts work together, and identify potential areas for improvement or optimization. This can be useful in a wide range of contexts, from understanding the supply chain of a business to analyzing the ecological impact of human activity.

Key Takeaways:

A system is an entity with interrelated and interdependent parts. It is defined by its modules, by the boundaries between the modules, and by their interaction.
The computational systems thinking design process is as follows: database -&gt; choose modules -&gt; compose modules -&gt; simulate and verify -&gt; fabricate.

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Architecture is a representation of entities organized in a way that supports reasoning about the entities and describes behaviors and relationships amongst the entities. 
A concept is a product or system vision, idea, notion, or mental image that maps function to form in brief. It is a simplification of the system architecture that allows for high-level reasoning.
A solution-neutral function explains a function without specifying the solution that allows one to achieve that function. Solution-neutral is not an absolute property but rather a spectrum of more solution-neutral to less solution-neutral.
Architecture is a way to organize and reason about entities, including their behaviors and relationships. It provides a high-level view of a system that can be used to guide its development and evolution.

A concept is a high-level idea or vision for a product or system that maps function to form. It is often used in the early stages of development to help define the goals and scope of the system.

A solution-neutral function is a way to describe a function without specifying a specific solution or implementation. It allows for more flexibility and creativity in finding solutions to meet the function, and is often used in the early stages of design.

Together, these concepts provide a framework for thinking about and designing complex systems. By using architecture to organize and reason about entities, concepts to define the goals and scope of a system, and solution-neutral functions to describe what a system should do without specifying how it should do it, designers and developers can create innovative and effective solutions to complex problems.

Yes, the transition point from solution-neutral to solution-specific marks the point at which design parameters and technology choices become more explicit.

At the solution-neutral end of the spectrum, functions are described without reference to any specific solution or implementation. As a result, design parameters and technology choices are not yet explicit, and there is more flexibility to explore different solutions.

As a design moves towards the solution-specific end of the spectrum, design parameters and technology choices become more explicit. This is necessary to enable value-related functions to be executed and enabled by form, and to establish the vocabulary and architecture of the system. At this point, the designer must make more concrete decisions about how the system will be implemented, including the level of technology to be used.

In general, the transition from solution-neutral to solution-specific marks the point at which a design becomes more concrete and detailed, and moves from the realm of high-level vision and concept to the realm of practical implementation. This transition is critical to the success of any design project, as it sets the stage for the development of a detailed architecture and the implementation of a functional system.

Yes, these are correct definitions of sensitivity and connectivity.

Sensitivity refers to the degree to which a particular decision or input affects the output or performance of a system. Sensitivity analysis is a technique used to evaluate the sensitivity of a system to changes in specific inputs or parameters, and is often used to identify the most critical inputs or factors affecting system performance.

Connectivity, on the other hand, refers to the degree to which making a particular decision or change affects other decisions or parts of a system. In other words, connectivity measures the interdependence of different parts of a system, and how changes to one part can ripple through the rest of the system. Connectivity analysis is often used to identify potential bottlenecks, dependencies, or conflicts within a system, and to optimize the system for overall performance.

Both sensitivity and connectivity are important concepts in systems thinking and analysis, and are often used in conjunction with other techniques and methods to understand and improve the performance of complex systems.

<h4 id="dsm-design-structure-matrix">DSM - Design Structure Matrix<a class="headerlink" href="#dsm-design-structure-matrix" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>The Design Structure Matrix (DSM) is a tool used to represent the relationships between the components or activities in a complex system or project. It is a square matrix that shows the interactions between the different parts of a system or project, such as the flow of information, dependencies, and feedback loops. The rows and columns of the matrix represent the components or activities, and the cells show the strength and nature of the relationships between them.

The DSM is a powerful tool for visualizing the complexity of a system or project, and it can be used to identify areas of high interdependency, potential bottlenecks, and opportunities for optimization. It can also be used to track changes in the system over time, and to identify the impact of changes on other components or activities.

There are different types of DSMs, such as binary DSMs, valued DSMs, and hybrid DSMs. Binary DSMs represent the relationships between components or activities as either present or absent, while valued DSMs assign a numerical value to each relationship to represent its strength. Hybrid DSMs combine both binary and valued relationships to provide a more comprehensive view of the system.

DSMs are commonly used in engineering, project management, and systems analysis to improve the design, development, and implementation of complex systems and projects. They are also useful in other fields, such as organizational design, supply chain management, and software development.

Your statements are mostly correct. I’ll just make a few adjustments for clarity and completeness:

Decomposition is the breaking down of a larger entity into smaller, more manageable components or parts.
A process is a set of actions or operations that transform inputs into outputs, and typically occurs over time.
The Design Structure Matrix (DSM) is a tool for representing the relationships between components or activities in a complex system or project, and is often used in systems engineering and project management.
System architecture is the process of defining the structure and behavior of a system, including its components, their relationships, and the interfaces between them.
An interface is a shared boundary or connection between two systems, components, or subsystems, through which they interact or exchange information.
Process architecture is the design of the overall structure and flow of a process system, including its components, functions, and interactions. It is a key aspect of process engineering and optimization.

Certainly! Here’s a more detailed explanation of the concepts I mentioned:

Decomposition: This is a technique used in engineering and other fields to simplify complex systems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable parts or components. Each component can then be designed, analyzed, and optimized separately, before being integrated back into the larger system. Decomposition is often used in systems engineering, software development, and project management.

Process: A process is a set of actions or operations that transform inputs into outputs. Processes can be applied to a wide range of domains, from manufacturing and logistics to software development and business operations. Examples of processes include production lines, supply chains, software development workflows, and customer service interactions. A process typically involves multiple steps or stages, and may include feedback loops, decision points, and quality control measures.

Design Structure Matrix (DSM): The DSM is a tool used to represent the relationships between components or activities in a complex system or project. It is a square matrix where each row and column represents a component or activity, and the cells represent the strength and nature of the relationships between them. DSMs are often used in systems engineering and project management to model the structure of complex systems or processes, and to identify areas of high interdependency or potential bottlenecks.

System architecture: System architecture is the process of defining the structure and behavior of a system, including its components, their relationships, and the interfaces between them. This involves identifying the key functions and requirements of the system, and designing the overall structure and organization of its components to meet those requirements. System architecture is a critical aspect of systems engineering, software development, and other fields where complex systems need to be designed and optimized.

Interface: An interface is a shared boundary or connection between two systems, components, or subsystems, through which they interact or exchange information. Interfaces can take many forms, such as hardware ports, software APIs, or human-machine interfaces. A well-designed interface is essential for ensuring efficient and effective communication between different parts of a system, and for enabling interoperability with other systems.

Process architecture: Process architecture is the design of the overall structure and flow of a process system, including its components, functions, and interactions. It is a key aspect of process engineering and optimization, and involves analyzing the inputs and outputs of a process, identifying the key stages and functions, and designing the flow of materials, information, and resources through the system. Process architecture is important for improving process efficiency, reducing waste, and enhancing product quality.

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>There are several tools and techniques that can be used for decomposing systems into components. Here are some common ones:

Functional Decomposition: This involves breaking down a system into its functional components, based on the system’s primary objectives and requirements. Each functional component represents a distinct set of capabilities or behaviors that contribute to the overall function of the system. This approach is often used in systems engineering and software development.

Object-Oriented Design: This involves breaking down a system into its object-oriented components, based on the system’s data structures and behavior patterns. Each object represents a distinct data structure and a set of methods or functions that operate on that data. This approach is often used in software development.

Hierarchical Task Analysis: This involves breaking down a system into its component tasks and sub-tasks, based on the system’s operational requirements and human factors. Each task represents a distinct set of actions or operations that contribute to the overall function of the system. This approach is often used in human factors engineering and usability design.

Value Stream Mapping: This involves breaking down a system into its value streams, based on the system’s key inputs, outputs, and value-adding activities. Each value stream represents a distinct set of activities that contribute to the overall value proposition of the system. This approach is often used in lean manufacturing and process optimization.

Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA): This involves breaking down a system into its potential failure modes and their effects, based on the system’s criticality and risk factors. Each failure mode represents a distinct potential point of failure in the system, and the associated effects represent the potential consequences of that failure. This approach is often used in quality management and risk analysis.

Each of these tools and techniques can be used to decompose a system into its component parts and provide insights into the system’s structure, function, and performance. The choice of tool or technique will depend on the specific requirements of the system and the goals of the analysis.

Agile is not a tool for decomposing systems into components, but rather a project management methodology for developing software and other products. However, Agile can be used in conjunction with some of the tools and techniques for decomposing systems into components that I mentioned earlier.

For example, the Agile methodology emphasizes iterative and incremental development, which can be supported by functional decomposition and object-oriented design. By breaking down the system into functional components or objects, Agile teams can develop and test each component or object in isolation, and then integrate them into the larger system over time.

Similarly, Agile teams can use value stream mapping and hierarchical task analysis to identify and prioritize the most valuable and critical components or tasks of the system, and to develop and test them in an iterative and incremental manner. Failure mode and effects analysis can also be used to identify potential risks and failures in the system, and to develop mitigation strategies as part of the Agile development process.

So while Agile is not a tool for decomposing systems into components per se, it can be used in conjunction with other tools and techniques to support the development and optimization of complex systems.

Sure, here’s some more information on Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA):

-- expand on Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA) and how it can be used to decompose systems into components.

Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA) is a structured method for analyzing and decomposing complex tasks or systems into their constituent sub-tasks and activities. It is based on the premise that complex tasks can be broken down into simpler, more manageable sub-tasks, which can then be analyzed and optimized separately.

HTA is typically used in the fields of human factors engineering, usability design, and process optimization. It can be used to identify areas of inefficiency, complexity, and error-proneness in a system, and to develop more streamlined and efficient workflows.

The process of performing HTA involves several steps:

Task identification: Identify the primary tasks or objectives of the system, and break them down into their constituent sub-tasks.

Task analysis: Analyze each sub-task in detail, identifying the specific inputs, outputs, and operations required to perform it.

Hierarchical structuring: Organize the sub-tasks into a hierarchical structure, based on their dependencies and relationships to each other.

Evaluation: Evaluate the hierarchical structure to identify areas of redundancy, complexity, or inefficiency, and develop optimization strategies to address these issues.

HTA can be performed using a variety of techniques, such as interviews with subject matter experts, observation of system use, and analysis of task performance data. HTA can also be supported by software tools, such as flowcharting software or task analysis software.

HTA has several benefits, including improved system efficiency, reduced error rates, and enhanced usability. It can also help to identify areas for process improvement and cost savings, and can be used to support continuous improvement initiatives.

<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>A process architecture DSM model is a visual representation of the dependencies between tasks in a process. It is used to identify potential problems or bottlenecks in the process, and to help optimize the flow of work.

A DSM model consists of a matrix that represents the tasks in the process, and the dependencies between them. The matrix is typically square, with each row and column representing a task in the process. The values in the matrix represent the dependencies between tasks, where a 1 indicates that a task depends on another task.

There are two main types of DSM models:

Sequential DSM: In a sequential DSM model, the matrix represents the sequence of tasks in the process. The values in the matrix indicate the order in which the tasks should be performed. A lower value in the matrix indicates that a task should be performed earlier in the process.

Coupled DSM: In a coupled DSM model, the matrix represents the groups of tasks that are coupled together. Tasks that belong to the same group are placed in the same column of the matrix. This type of DSM model is useful for identifying dependencies between groups of tasks, and for optimizing the flow of work between different departments or teams.

DSM models can be created using a variety of tools and techniques, including spreadsheets, specialized software, or programming languages like Python. The choice of tool depends on the complexity of the process, the amount of data to be analyzed, and the specific requirements of the project.

To create a DSM that shows the sequence of tasks in a process architecture, you can modify the example code I provided earlier. Instead of using a binary matrix to represent dependencies, you can use an integer matrix to represent the sequence of tasks.

Here’s an example code that demonstrates how to create a sequenced process architecture DSM with four tasks:

```python
import numpy as np

<span class="gh"># Define the tasks in the process architecture</span>
tasks = [&quot;Task 1&quot;, &quot;Task 2&quot;, &quot;Task 3&quot;, &quot;Task 4&quot;]

<span class="gh"># Define the sequence of tasks</span>
seq_matrix = np.array([
    [0, 1, 2, 0],  # Task 1 comes first, followed by Task 2 and Task 3
    [0, 0, 1, 2],  # Task 2 comes after Task 1, followed by Task 3 and Task 4
    [0, 0, 0, 1],  # Task 3 comes after Task 2, followed by Task 4
    [0, 0, 0, 0]   # Task 4 has no dependencies
])

<span class="gh"># Create the DSM matrix</span>
dsm_matrix = np.zeros((len(tasks), len(tasks)))
for i in range(len(tasks)):
    for j in range(len(tasks)):
        if seq_matrix[i][j] &gt; 0:
            dsm_matrix[i][j] = seq_matrix[i][j] - 1

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Here are the steps to create a Process Architecture DSM:

Identify the processes: Identify the different processes involved in the project or system. This may involve breaking down the project or system into smaller components, such as tasks, functions, or modules.

Define the inputs and outputs: For each process, define the inputs and outputs. The inputs are the resources or data that the process requires to function, while the outputs are the results or products that the process generates.

Create a matrix: Create a matrix with rows and columns representing the different processes. The intersection of each row and column represents the interaction between the processes.

Fill in the matrix: For each intersection, indicate whether there is a dependency between the processes. A dependency can be either positive or negative, indicating whether the processes are mutually dependent or independent of each other.

Analyze the DSM: Analyze the DSM to identify any potential issues or bottlenecks in the process. Look for cycles or loops in the DSM, which indicate circular dependencies that can lead to delays or errors in the process. Also, look for clusters or groups of processes that interact heavily with each other, which can help to identify areas for optimization or streamlining.

Optimize the DSM: Use the DSM to optimize the flow of work between different processes. Look for ways to reduce dependencies or reorganize the process to eliminate bottlenecks or inefficiencies.

Refine the DSM: Refine the DSM as needed based on feedback from stakeholders and changes in the project or system.

Creating a Process Architecture DSM can be a complex and iterative process that requires careful planning and analysis. It is important to involve stakeholders from different departments or teams to ensure that the DSM accurately represents the interactions between different processes and to obtain buy-in for any changes or optimizations.

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Prof. Crawley’s case studies of the Saturn V launch vehicle and the International Space Station highlight the importance of decomposition in large engineering projects.

The Saturn V launch vehicle was a massive engineering project that involved many different systems and components, including engines, fuel tanks, guidance systems, and more. To manage such a complex project, the engineering team used a top-down decomposition approach to break the overall system into smaller, more manageable subsystems. Each subsystem was then further decomposed into smaller components, until each component was small enough to be designed and built by a single engineer or team.

This approach allowed the engineering team to manage the complexity of the overall system and ensure that each subsystem and component was designed and built to meet the overall system requirements. It also allowed for more efficient design and development, as each team could focus on their specific component without worrying about how it fit into the overall system.

The International Space Station is another example of a complex engineering project that required a decomposition approach. The Space Station was designed and built by multiple international partners, each of whom contributed different subsystems and components. To manage the complexity of the project, the engineering team used a bottom-up decomposition approach, where each subsystem was designed and built independently before being integrated into the overall system.

This approach allowed each partner to focus on their specific subsystem without worrying about the other subsystems, and also allowed for easier integration of the subsystems into the overall system. However, it required careful coordination and communication between the partners to ensure that each subsystem met the overall system requirements and could be integrated into the final design.

Overall, the case studies of the Saturn V launch vehicle and the International Space Station demonstrate the power of decomposition in managing complex engineering projects. Whether using a top-down or bottom-up approach, decomposition allows engineers to break down the overall system into smaller, more manageable subsystems and components, ensuring that each component is designed and built to meet the overall system requirements and can be easily integrated into the final design.

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>This week&#39;s central theme was DSM, a tool that maps different entities within a complex system. DSM helps you understand the interactions among entities/subsystems/components. It also allows you to manage these interactions to align product development with the goals and needs of the system.

There are three types of DSMs:

Formal or structural DSM: Used to map the formal/physical interactions among the various components of the system.
Process/Task DSM: Used to identify sequencing and grouping of system tasks or processes.  
Organization DSM: Used to map the interactions between people within an organization.
You also learned how to cluster entities of a DSM into groups. These groups allow you to better manage the emergence of the system. Additionally, you learned the two down, one up approach that helps generate better decomposition at Level One by looking at interactions between entities/components a level down. You saw this approach applied to real-world systems, such as the International Space Station and Saturn V.   

In the last section, you looked at change request propagation, which is a fundamental attribute of any complex system and one that an architect must consider when designing the architecture of the system. Gaining clarity on how change requests propagate through a system enables you to manage them more efficiently. For example, you can correlate the likelihood of change propagation to attributes, such as the connectedness of the components to other parts of the system. By having this visibility, you can predict how a change might affect the system and take measures to prevent the propagation of changes to other parts of the system.

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Multivalue tradespace exploration is a decision support methodology used in systems engineering, project management, and other fields to evaluate and compare various alternatives based on multiple criteria or attributes. The approach aims to help decision-makers identify optimal solutions that strike the right balance between conflicting objectives and values. The term “tradespace” refers to the range of design choices, options, or alternatives available to address a specific problem or achieve a goal.

In multivalue tradespace exploration, the decision-making process begins by identifying the relevant criteria or attributes that matter to the stakeholders. These criteria can include performance, cost, risk, and other factors that are important for the decision at hand. Next, a range of alternatives is generated, each representing a different combination of choices that meet the defined objectives. Then, the alternatives are evaluated and compared based on the identified criteria, often using quantitative or qualitative measures.

The exploration of the tradespace allows decision-makers to identify trade-offs between different alternatives and understand how adjusting one attribute might impact others. Visualization tools, such as Pareto frontiers, are often used to graphically represent the relationships between different criteria, enabling stakeholders to see how alternatives compare across multiple dimensions. This process helps decision-makers understand the implications of various choices and supports more informed, objective, and transparent decision-making.

In summary, multivalue tradespace exploration is a methodology that aids decision-makers in evaluating and comparing a range of alternatives based on multiple criteria. By identifying trade-offs and understanding the relationships between different attributes, stakeholders can make more informed decisions and select optimal solutions that balance competing objectives.

<h4 id="multiple-criteria-decision-analysis">multiple criteria decision analysis<a class="headerlink" href="#multiple-criteria-decision-analysis" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>It turns out that many decisions people need to make involve multiple criteria, even though they might tend to fixate on the most important criterion. For example, when purchasing disposable goods, such as groceries, consumers may focus on price as a single criterion. However, sometimes the quality of the grocery item matters as much or more than the price. Consumers are then faced with at least two criteria that may compete with each other: Can I get a high quality good at a low price? Certainly many people search for such deals.

This problem is heightened even more with complex systems that have multiple stakeholders with (potentially) different needs. Consider, for example, designing a new smartphone. There could be multiple criteria of interest across multiple stakeholders. If you look at the phone from the user’s perspective, some of the important characteristics might include UI, battery life, ruggedization, camera, screen quality, audio, form factor, ease of repair, and support. The phone manufacturer has other needs that are important — for example, production cost, manufacturing time, availability of suppliers, changes to the existing production facility, impact on existing products, and brand name.

The development team, suppliers, and other stakeholders similarly have other needs. Some of these needs might directly translate to decision criteria, while others might create one or more criteria. It is a challenge to keep track of and organize the diverse needs on a project of this scale, where the decision makers have to balance so many different decision criteria with no common units on which to compare them. For example, reducing production cost might conflict with improving battery life, or camera or screen quality; furthermore, it&#39;s difficult to quantify them on a single common unit. In these cases, it is important to have a structured and formal process that makes the comparison across the numerous attributes more efficient. Such a process also identifies any conflicts and synergies that become the basis of trade-off analyses to make better decisions.

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>The table highlights the differences between value-focused thinking and alternative-focused thinking in decision-making processes. Each approach has its unique characteristics, benefits, and drawbacks, which can influence the quality and effectiveness of the decisions made.

Value-Focused Thinking:

Value-focused thinking emphasizes the underlying rationale for creating value and seeks to maximize the value derived from a system or decision. This approach focuses on understanding the objectives, values, and preferences of the decision-makers and stakeholders, which serve as the foundation for decision-making.
This method starts with defining the problem and the desired outcomes before considering potential solutions. By doing so, it ensures that the decision-making process remains centered on the core objectives and desired results.
Value-focused thinking tends to be solution-neutral, meaning it doesn’t favor any specific solution from the outset. This allows for a more open and creative exploration of potential solutions and encourages the generation of new ideas that might not have been considered otherwise.
The value-focused approach often requires more time and effort, as it involves a thorough examination of the problem, objectives, and criteria before evaluating and selecting a solution.

Alternative-Focused Thinking:

Alternative-focused thinking aims to identify the best possible solution from a predefined set of alternatives. This approach is more focused on comparing and selecting among existing options rather than exploring new possibilities.
Instead of starting with the problem, alternative-focused thinking starts with a potential solution or a set of solutions. This can lead to a narrower perspective on the problem and may limit the range of solutions considered.
This method is solution-specific, as it evaluates the decision based on the available alternatives. This can result in a more constrained decision-making process and may hinder the discovery of more innovative or effective solutions.
Alternative-focused thinking tends to be quicker, as it involves selecting a solution from a predetermined set of options. This can be beneficial when time is a critical factor, but it may also lead to less optimal decisions if the available alternatives do not fully address the problem or meet the desired objectives.

In summary, value-focused and alternative-focused thinking represent two distinct approaches to decision-making. Value-focused thinking emphasizes the underlying rationale for creating value and starts with the problem, while alternative-focused thinking aims to identify the best solution from a set of available alternatives and starts with potential solutions. Each approach has its advantages and disadvantages, and the choice between them depends on the specific context, objectives, and constraints of the decision at hand.

<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>One of the key benefits of engaging with stakeholders early and using value-focused thinking is that it increases the likelihood of success at decision time. Most systems engineering processes have key milestone reviews, the outcome of which are critical decisions that shape what a system can end up becoming. These include decisions such as concept selection, budget, and schedule allocation; requirements encoding; assigning specifications to a design; verification that a particular design meets requirements; and validation that a particular system meets the espoused needs.

Every organization may have a different set of processes and key milestones; however, usually, these are the critical times when preferences (i.e., the values) of critical stakeholders are made known. Sometimes key stakeholder needs are not even known until later in the lifecycle (i.e., new customers using a product after development). In order to reduce delays in the system development processes and increase the chances that the proposed system solutions meet or exceed expectations, you can use quantitative methods to generate compelling and aligned evidence that you are developing good solutions. For example, using quantitative value models as proxies for stakeholder needs ensures alignment of your development efforts in between those critical milestone reviews.

Abstract: Evidence-based SE is an extension of model-based SE that emphasizes not only using SysML or other system models as a basis of program decisions but also the use of other models to produce evidence that the system models describe a feasible system. Such evidence is generally desired, but it is often not produced because it is not identified as a project deliverable in a data item description (DID). Going forward with such unproven solutions frequently leads to large program overruns.

Based on experience in developing and using such a DID on a very large project, let’s summarize the content and form of such a DID and a rationale for its use. Its basic content is evidence that if a system were produced with the specified architecture, it would:

Satisfy the specified operational concept and requirements;
Be developable within the specified budget and schedule;
Provide a superior return on investment over alternatives in terms of mission effectiveness; and
Provide satisfactory outcomes for the system&#39;s success-critical stakeholders.
One key factor of the DID is that the content of the evidence should be risk-balanced between having too little evidence (often the case today) and having too much (analysis paralysis). Thus, it is not a one-size-fits-all DID, but it is one that has ways to be tailored to a project&#39;s most critical evidence needs.

Download Multi-Attribute Tradespace Exploration with Concurrent Design as a Value-Centric Framework for Space System Architecture and Design. Adam Ross, Masters Thesis, 2003. 

Abstract: The complexity inherent in space systems necessarily requires intense expenditures of resources both human and monetary. The high level of ambiguity present in the early design phases of these systems causes long, highly iterative, and costly design cycles, especially due to the need to create robust systems that are inaccessible after deployment. This thesis looks at incorporating decision theory methods into the early design processes to streamline communication of wants and needs among stakeholders and between levels of design. Communication channeled through formal utility interviews and analysis enables engineers to better understand the key drivers for the system and allows for a broad and more thorough exploration of the design tradespace. 

Multi-attribute tradespace exploration (MATE), an evolving process incorporating decision theory into model and simulation-based design, has been applied to several space system projects. The conclusions of these studies indicate that this process can improve the quality of communication to more quickly resolve project ambiguity and enable the engineer to discover better value designs for multiple stakeholders. Sets of design options, as opposed to point designs, in addition to the structure of the solution space, can be analyzed and communicated through the output of this process. 

MATE is also being integrated into a concurrent design environment to facilitate the transfer of knowledge of important drivers into higher fidelity design phases. Formal utility theory provides a mechanism to bridge the language barrier between experts of different backgrounds and differing needs (e.g., scientists, engineers, and managers). MATE with concurrent design (MATE-CON) couples decision makers more closely to the design and, most importantly, maintains their presence between formal reviews. The presence of a MATE-CON chair in the concurrent design environment represents a unique contribution of this process. In addition to the development of the process itself, this thesis uses design structure matrix (DSM) analysis to compare the structure of the MATE-CON process to that of the NASA systems engineering process and that of a US space organization to gain insights into their relative temporal performance. Through both qualitative and quantitative discussions, the MATE-CON process, which is derived from the fundamental concept of engineering, is shown to be a “better” method for delivering value to key decision makers.

This paper focuses on the development of an evidence-based systems engineering (SE) data item description (DID) that aims to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of systems engineering practices.

The authors propose a DID that is based on empirical evidence from past systems engineering projects, which can help organizations better understand the factors that contribute to project success or failure. By leveraging lessons learned from previous projects, the proposed DID can guide systems engineers in identifying and managing critical elements that influence project outcomes.

The paper discusses the key components of the evidence-based DID, including the purpose, scope, and approach for collecting and analyzing relevant data from past systems engineering projects. It also presents a case study that demonstrates the application of the evidence-based DID in a real-world project.

Overall, the goal of the paper is to contribute to the advancement of systems engineering practices by promoting the use of empirical evidence in decision-making and project management. By applying an evidence-based DID, organizations can improve the effectiveness of their systems engineering processes, reduce risks, and enhance the chances of project success.

The thesis presents a value-centric framework for evaluating and designing space system architectures using multi-attribute tradespace exploration (MATE) and concurrent design principles.

The main objective of the research is to develop a systematic approach to support decision-making in the early stages of space system design by identifying and evaluating various alternatives based on multiple criteria or attributes. This is done by integrating MATE, a method that allows decision-makers to analyze trade-offs between different alternatives across multiple dimensions, with concurrent design principles that emphasize simultaneous consideration of all aspects of the system during the design process.

The value-centric framework proposed in this thesis aims to shift the focus from merely evaluating available alternatives to understanding and maximizing the value delivered by the system. This is achieved by identifying stakeholder preferences, objectives, and values, which serve as the foundation for decision-making. The MATE process enables stakeholders to explore the tradespace and assess the relationships between different design attributes, helping them to identify the most suitable solutions that balance competing objectives.

The thesis also demonstrates the application of the proposed framework in a case study involving the design of a space-based Earth observation system. The case study illustrates how the value-centric framework and MATE can be used to inform the decision-making process and facilitate the selection of an optimal space system architecture that meets stakeholder needs and maximizes value.

In summary, Adam Ross’s Master’s thesis presents a value-centric framework that combines multi-attribute tradespace exploration and concurrent design principles for space system architecture and design. The research aims to support decision-making in the early stages of design by enabling stakeholders to assess trade-offs between different alternatives and maximize the value derived from the system.

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Definitions:

Design value loop perspective is a problem-to-solution decision-making approach that uses three types of models in two categories — evaluative models (performance and cost) and value models — to encourage feedback and the explicit separation of objective (e.g., evaluative models) and subjective (e.g., value) considerations. The goal in this perspective is to find alternatives with a design space that best satisfies expectations on the value space. The basic design value loop includes a design space that contains all the proposed solutions that could address the problem. In order to evaluate the design space, let’s split the evaluation space further into three spaces: the resource space, the performance space, and the value space. The resource space defines what resources or costs are involved in solving the particular problem. These costs and resources are calculated using the cost model. Next is the performance space, which defines the performance criteria that the potential design solutions should meet in order to be considered. These performance criteria are calculated using certain performance models. The third and final one is the value space, which defines the set of value related attributes and criteria to evaluate the potential design space. These value criteria are over and above the resource and performance criteria mentioned earlier, and these attributes are identified using value models, which will be discussed in more detail in the next sections. 
Design space is the span of possible alternative solutions to the system design problem, from which one or more could be picked and are under the control of the designer, usually consisting of distinct concepts, architectures, and particular designs.
Cost models evaluate potential design in terms of the resources (usually different types of cost, such as design, develop, manufacture, test, operate, and lifecycle) required for their realization.
Performance models evaluate potential design in terms of capabilities or performance they provide to help address the underlying goals and objectives. These are usually related to the behavior of the design, such as top speed, range, efficiency, etc.
Value models assign quantitative scores to potential design in terms of the perceived satisfaction, or benefit at cost, they generate while addressing the underlying goals and objectives. 
Value space is the span of possible alternative solutions to the system design problem, from which one or more could be picked and are under the control of the designer, usually consisting of distinct concepts, architectures, and particular designs.

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>There are many single attribute techniques for translating criteria into value metrics, approximating how decision makers interpret the value of different levels of a given criterion. Two common approaches are described below.

Net Present Value (NPV) Method

With this approach, you calculate a single number to roll up a time series of a metric (usually a cash flow or other monetary stream). It relies on two mathematical abstractions: time period and discount rate. The time period is the time frame discretization of the time-series metric; the discount rate is the exponential decay rate of loss of perceived benefit of that stream over that time period (i.e., a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow). Alternatives are scored according to their aggregated NPV, and those with the highest score are deemed the best.

Single Attribute Utility (SAU) Method

With this approach, you develop a model that quantifies the level of perceived satisfaction of various levels of an attribute under uncertainty. The axioms of this method require a monotonic curve (increasing or decreasing) that ranges (typically) from 0 (least acceptable level) to 1 (most desirable level) across the acceptance range of the considered attribute. Attribute scores above the most desirable level are assigned a “1,” while attribute scores below the minimum acceptable level are assigned “infeasible.”

Alternatives are assessed in terms of the attribute(s), and a single attribute utility score is interpolated from the SAU function based on the attribute level. Alternatives with the highest SAU scores are the best, although many could tie at 1 and would be considered an equivalently saturating perceived benefit. It is important to recognize that in this implementation of SAU, a score of 0 is still minimally acceptable, while a score of “infeasible” means that an alternative is unacceptable for having an attribute level below the minimum acceptable threshold.

Note: Generally, any function mapping attribute levels to degree of satisfaction is called a “value function.” A utility function is a special case of a value function that also takes into account uncertainty, which is the degree of satisfaction for an attribute level under uncertainty.

You must use multi-attribute approaches when there is more than one attribute that determines value. Various example multi-attribute methods of quantifying and comparing value are provided below. 

Lexicographic (Decision Matrix) Method

In this method, attributes or system goals are ranked according to the stakeholders’ preference. Then, all the alternatives are scored based on the most important attribute (as perceived by stakeholders), either using natural units or by normalizing the units. The alternatives are then ranked based on their calculated score. If there is a tie, you break the tie with the second most important attribute score.

Pugh (Controlled Convergence) Method 

In Pugh, a baseline alternative/solution is first selected. Then, each attribute of the baseline is compared with the corresponding attribute for the other available alternatives and marked with either “+”, “S” or “-”: “+” (Plus) if the attribute value of the alternative is better than that of the baseline; - (Minus) if the attribute value of the alternative is worse than that of the baseline; and S (Same) if it is the same as that of the baseline. 

Once all the alternatives have been compared, each of the +, S and - values for every alternative are summed. The alternative that has the best scores for each of the three comparison values is ranked first, and so on. 

QFD-Like Method

In this method, attributes are ranked according to the stakeholders’ preference and assigned weights (they typically add up to 1). The scoring of the alternatives for each of the given attributes is done using a scale with four values: 0 (none), 1 (weak), 3 (moderate), and 9 (strong). Once all the attributes of every alternative have been scored, a weighted sum of the scores based on the attribute ranking is calculated. Alternatives are then ranked according to their weighted sum from the highest to the lowest.

Modified Decision Matrix Method 

The modified decision matrix method is similar to the lexicographic method. First, attributes are ranked by weight according to the stakeholders’ preference. Then, all the alternatives are scored on each of the given attributes either using natural units or by normalizing the units. A weighted score for each attribute for each alternative is then calculated by multiplying each individual attribute score times its attribute weight. Then, the weighted attribute scores are summed for each alternative, resulting in the overall weighted score. Once the overall weighted scores are calculated, each alternative is ranked from the highest to the lowest overall weighted score.

Multi-Attribute Utility (MAU) Method

For each attribute, you create a single attribute utility curve for that attribute, which maps the acceptance range for that attribute on a 0 (worst) to 1 (best) scale. Then, you assign weights for each of the attributes based on how well they satisfy the stakeholders’ objectives. Next, find the single attribute utility scores for each attribute across all of the alternatives by interpolating its utility value from the appropriate single attribute utility curve. Finally, create a score for each alternative by summing all of the utility values multiplied by their corresponding attribute weights. The alternatives with the highest score values are ranked first, and so on.

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)

Cost-benefit analysis is a prescriptive methodology that quantifies the net benefits yielded by a system relative to its respective net costs. CBA serves as a useful value-centric tool for cardinally weighting the positive and negative effects of various outcomes and combining them into a single metric. Most often, the costs and benefits are quantified using a monetary metric, which requires that all the direct costs and benefits associated with the system are transformed into monetary units. However, any cardinal scale may be used for CBA.

Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT)

CPT is a descriptive-based tool developed in response to the belief that the normative expected utility theory does not appropriately characterize decision making under uncertainty. It is an improvement on prospect theory. CPT is directly aimed at modifying utility theory to account for observed violations of expected utility theory while making as few modifications as possible. The result of CPT is evident in its respective loss-gain, or “S”, curve, which forms a value function representing the behavioral characteristics of stakeholders under uncertainty, much as utility theory does, but in monetary terms instead. 

Value Functions (VFs)

Value functions can be broadly categorized as functions that quantify, in any cardinal unit of measure (although usually in monetary units), the intrinsic value of a system, which in turn is determined under certainty, and VFs may be ascertained so that they exist as an ordinal or cardinal function. VFs capture the elicitation of stakeholder preferences about the outcome of a situation, which is known with certainty, in terms of how much they would be willing to pay to have that outcome occur or not occur. Hence, VFs most often assume a monetary form and embody a stakeholder’s change in wealth relative to a given set of outcomes. 

Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)

AHP is a method for systematically decomposing a system into a hierarchy of desirable attributes that aggregate to an overarching goal. The manifestation of this is a decision tree (or matrix), where the highest order of the tree/matrix is the goal to be achieved, and logically disseminating from this are a set of decisions, or attributes, where each attribute aggregates a set of attributes that collectively comprise that attribute at the next higher level in the hierarchy. Through a simple algorithm and appropriate weighting of each ensuing node of the decision tree via pairwise comparisons, this hierarchy is then used to mathematically inform decisions as to the most valuable system or decision meeting the overarching goal. 

There are many value models in use. In general, value models are a quantitative proxy for a decision maker, and seek to map “degree of satisfaction” across a possible attribute range or set of ranges. Value models include various single and multiple attribute transformations. The key takeaway is that all value models are abstractions. Use of particular value models should take into account their assumptions and applicability, along with considerations for how they will be used in the decision-making process (e.g., availability of data and transparency of recommendations)

<h4 id="lexicographic-method">Lexicographic Method<a class="headerlink" href="#lexicographic-method" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>The lexicographic method is a multi-attribute method that is used to rank alternatives based on a set of attributes. The method is based on the idea that the decision maker has a set of attributes that are important to them, and that the decision maker ranks the attributes in order of importance. The method is also known as the decision matrix method.

The lexicographic method is a decision-making technique used to rank or select alternatives based on multiple criteria or attributes. In this method, the decision-maker orders the criteria in terms of importance or priority. The alternatives are then compared based on the most important criterion first. If there is a clear winner based on the most important criterion, the decision is made. If not, the decision-maker proceeds to the next most important criterion and continues this process until a winner is found or all the criteria have been considered.

The lexicographic method can be described in the following steps:

Identify the alternatives and criteria: List all the available alternatives and the criteria relevant to the decision-making process.
Prioritize the criteria: Order the criteria by importance, with the most important criterion ranked first and the least important criterion ranked last.
Compare alternatives based on the most important criterion: Evaluate the alternatives based on the highest-ranked criterion. If one alternative is clearly superior to the others, it is selected as the best choice. If there is a tie, proceed to the next step.
Compare alternatives based on the next most important criterion: If a tie exists, evaluate the tied alternatives based on the next highest-ranked criterion. If a clear winner emerges, it is selected as the best choice. If there is still a tie, continue with the next criterion.
Repeat the process until a winner is found or all criteria have been considered: Continue comparing the alternatives based on the prioritized criteria until a clear winner is identified or all criteria have been exhausted. If a winner is not found after considering all criteria, the decision-maker may need to revisit the criteria, priorities, or decision-making process.

The lexicographic method is a simple and intuitive decision-making technique, but it has some limitations. It does not account for the relative importance of criteria beyond their ordinal ranking and does not allow for trade-offs between criteria. This can lead to biased or suboptimal decisions, especially when the differences between criteria are small or the relative importance of criteria is not accurately captured by their ordinal ranking. In such cases, alternative decision-making techniques, such as the weighted sum method or multi-criteria decision analysis, may be more appropriate.

Given the limitations of the lexicographic method, a better alternative for decision-making could be the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) or Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA). Both of these methods are more robust and capable of addressing the complexities that arise when dealing with multiple criteria and their relative importance.

Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP): AHP is a structured decision-making technique that uses a hierarchical framework to evaluate and prioritize alternatives based on multiple criteria. In AHP, decision-makers assign relative importance (weights) to the criteria and pairwise compare the alternatives for each criterion. The process involves the following steps:

Define the problem and identify the alternatives and criteria.
Organize the criteria into a hierarchical structure.
Perform pairwise comparisons of criteria to establish their relative importance (weights).
Perform pairwise comparisons of alternatives for each criterion.
Calculate the overall scores for each alternative by combining the pairwise comparisons and criteria weights.
Rank the alternatives based on their overall scores and select the one with the highest score.

Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA): MCDA is a general term for a group of decision-making techniques that involve evaluating and ranking alternatives based on multiple criteria. These techniques take into account the relative importance (weights) of the criteria and often allow for trade-offs between them. Some popular MCDA methods include the Weighted Sum Model (WSM), the Weighted Product Model (WPM), and the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). These methods involve assigning weights to criteria, scoring alternatives based on the criteria, and aggregating the scores to rank the alternatives.

Both AHP and MCDA offer more flexibility and transparency in the decision-making process compared to the lexicographic method. They can accommodate the relative importance of criteria and allow for trade-offs, resulting in more accurate and well-informed decisions. However, they can also be more complex and time-consuming to implement, requiring additional data and expertise. Choosing the most appropriate method will depend on the specific context and requirements of the decision at hand.

The Pugh Method, also known as the Pugh Matrix or Pugh Concept Selection, is a decision-making technique used to compare and rank multiple alternatives based on multiple criteria. It is particularly useful in the early stages of product design or system development when multiple concepts are being evaluated. The method uses a structured approach that enables decision-makers to systematically compare alternatives against a chosen baseline or reference concept, resulting in a better understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of each option.

Here are the steps to implement the Pugh Method:

Define the problem and identify the alternatives and criteria: Clearly state the problem and list all the potential alternatives (concepts or solutions) and the criteria relevant to the decision-making process.

Choose a reference concept or baseline: Select one of the alternatives as a reference or baseline against which all other alternatives will be compared. The choice of reference concept can be arbitrary, or it can be an existing solution, a best-in-class product, or a concept that is familiar to the decision-makers.

Create a decision matrix: Set up a matrix with the alternatives listed in rows and the criteria listed in columns. Place the reference concept in the first row.

Perform pairwise comparisons: For each criterion, compare the remaining alternatives to the reference concept. If an alternative is better than the reference concept for a specific criterion, assign a score of +1. If it is worse, assign a score of -1. If there is no significant difference, assign a score of 0.

Calculate the total scores for each alternative: Sum the scores for each alternative across all criteria to obtain the total score.

Rank the alternatives: Rank the alternatives based on their total scores, with higher scores indicating better performance relative to the reference concept.

Iterate and refine: The Pugh Method can be an iterative process. If needed, repeat the process with a new reference concept or revised criteria to obtain a more accurate ranking of the alternatives.

The Pugh Method is a simple and intuitive decision-making technique that can be used to compare and rank multiple alternatives based on multiple criteria. It is particularly useful in the early stages of product design or system development when multiple concepts are being evaluated. The method uses a structured approach that enables decision-makers to systematically compare alternatives against a chosen baseline or reference concept, resulting in a better understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of each option.

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Operationalizing value with attributes refers to the process of breaking down a broader concept of value into specific, measurable, and tangible attributes that can be used to assess, compare, and optimize various aspects of a product, service, or system. This approach helps organizations make informed decisions based on objective and reliable data. Here are the steps to operationalize value with attributes:

Identify the overall value: Begin by defining the overarching concept of value for your organization or project, which might include factors such as customer satisfaction, profitability, or market share.

Break down value into components: Divide the overall value into smaller, more manageable components. These could be subcategories that contribute to the larger concept of value, such as cost-effectiveness, efficiency, and quality.

Define specific attributes: For each component, identify specific attributes that can be measured and analyzed. These attributes should be concrete and quantifiable, such as response time, error rate, or customer ratings.

Establish measurement criteria: Develop a clear and consistent method for measuring each attribute. This could involve creating scales, setting benchmarks, or using existing industry standards.

Collect data: Gather information on each attribute, either through existing data sources or by conducting new research. Make sure the data is accurate, reliable, and up-to-date to ensure informed decision-making.

Analyze and interpret data: Use statistical methods or qualitative analysis techniques to draw insights from the data. Identify trends, patterns, and areas of improvement related to each attribute.

Prioritize attributes: Determine the importance of each attribute in relation to the overall value. This can be done using techniques like the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) or by conducting stakeholder surveys.

Set goals and targets: Based on the analysis, set realistic and achievable targets for each attribute. These should be aligned with the organization’s broader objectives and strategies.

Implement improvements: Develop and implement action plans to improve performance on the prioritized attributes. This might involve process changes, new investments, or employee training.

Monitor progress: Regularly track progress towards the set goals and targets. Adjust the action plans as needed to ensure continuous improvement and optimization of value.

By operationalizing value with attributes, organizations can gain a better understanding of their performance, make data-driven decisions, and prioritize resources to maximize value creation.

<h4 id="axioms-of-utility-theory">Axioms of Utility Theory<a class="headerlink" href="#axioms-of-utility-theory" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Axioms of Utility Theory
One of the benefits of using an axiomatically based theory is that it is “correct” as long as the axioms hold. Such theories for decision making are deemed to be normative. That is, they describe how people should make decisions (if they adhered to the axioms, usually related to concepts of being “rational”). Research has shown that people do not really make decisions in such a “rational” manner but rather succumb to various heuristics and biases due to limited resources, such as attention, cognitive capacity, memory, training, and available information.

However, after being shown the axioms, decision makers often express a desire to make decisions in such a way that the axioms do hold. This means you can use normative decision theories, such as utility theory, in a prescriptive manner. That is, the decisions made with the assistance of these techniques could be better than those made unassisted. Any user of such decision theories needs to understand the underlying axioms and how to best apply them (i.e., utility theory is unlikely to predict how a decision maker might make a decision if left unassisted).

The existence of single attribute utility theory, as described in the previous section, relies on five basic axioms (de Neufville 1990) — that is, the assumptions about the situations. These axioms are:

Relative Preference  
As the name suggests, the axiom states the existence of relative preference from a set of all of the outcomes. It is also called the axiom of completeness, and it basically asserts that, for every pair of outcomes from a set of all of the outcomes, a person will either prefer one or the other or will show indifference between the two options. 

Mathematically, this can be represented as one of the following: 

X1 &gt; X2          
X1 ~ X2
X1 &lt; X2
This represents reasonable assumptions. In real life, people may encounter situations where the possible outcomes have slightly different attributes, and thus they may be undecided regarding which solution to pick or to fairly assess or compare them on the same scale. But, even in these situations, they eventually make a decision that is aligned with their preference for the given choices.

Transitivity
The axiom of transitivity states that you can infer a preference order between a pair of consequences given that you know the preference order between those consequences and a given intermediate consequence. In other words, given X1, X2 and X3, if you know that X1 &gt; X2 and X2 &gt; X3, then you can say that X1 &gt; X3.

This assumption is valid for a group with a common set of attributes or preferences. However, this might not hold for a group that has a diverse set of attributes, since the implied conditions that determine a preference order between one pair of consequences might not be valid for another pair. 

Monotonicity
The axiom of monotonicity, in simple terms, states that more of a good thing is better. A more formal definition states that the value of an item in a series is the weighted average of the values of the extreme. Given the greatest and the least value as Xmax and Xmin respectively, for all Xi, Xj within the series, where Xmax &gt;= Xi, Xj &gt;= Xmin, there is a number w that ranges between zero and one (0 w 1), such that some other Xk, lying between Xi and Xj, can be expressed as V(Xk) = wV(Xi) + (1 - w)V(Xj).

This can only be true if the preferences are monotonic. 

Existence
This axiom of utility functions is straightforward: it states that the probability of each outcome (consequences) exists and could be quantified for the given set of possible outcomes. The axiom is easy to verify as valid; however, it might be difficult to properly and accurately quantify the probability of some specific outcomes.

Substitution
As the name suggests, the probability monotonicity axiom states that a person prefers a greater chance of receiving a prize, given a particular outcome, rather than a lesser chance. In other words, given that we have two choices, each with the same uncertain outcomes X1 and X2, where X1 is preferred to X2, a person will prefer the choice with the greater probability of getting X1 (and the complementary, lesser probability of getting X2). The axiom assumes that the person’s preferences are linear in probability — i.e., for a given outcome, the better (or worse, depending on the criteria) the probability, the more value the person derives.

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>In addition to ensuring adherence to the assumptions of the theory, it is important to recognize the limitations in implementation as well. Decision makers must have preferences about the attributes for them to be useful. A common mistake made when implementing the multi-attribute utility approach is to select the attributes for the decision makers. The attribute selection process should be performed in close collaboration with decision making, actively involving them in the discussions until an agreed set of attributes have been derived. 

Another issue regarding attributes is the need to ensure that they are the appropriate decision metrics for the process. According to Smith et al. (1990), such sets must satisfy the following characteristics:

Completeness: The set characterizes all important factors to be considered in the decision-making process.
Comprehensiveness: Each attribute adequately characterizes its associated objective.
Importance: Each attribute is significant in that it has the potential to affect the preference ordering.
Measurability: Each attribute can be somehow quantified.
Familiarity: Decision makers must have a preference about each attribute. 
Non-redundancy: Two attributes should not measure the same objective to avoid double counting.
Independence: Each attribute must be perceived as independent of one another in order to ensure MAUA form (see Utility Independence Assumption).
It is important to remember that the human mind can typically only consider 7 ± 2 attributes simultaneously (Miller 1956). Beyond seven attributes, the decision maker will tend to focus solely on the most important attributes and will underweight the additional attributes. (This number will limit the number of attributes that can be considered during the corner point interviews.)

Additionally, it is important to be aware of human cognitive limitations. Kahneman and Tversky (1979) proposed that people in fact do not make decisions based on the absolute level of an outcome but rather in terms of gains or losses. They outlined four biases in how people actually make decisions that are inconsistent with traditional utility theory. These biases are: 

People make decisions based on changes of wealth rather than the absolute level.
People are loss-averse. People weight a loss of $100 about twice as much as a gain of $100.
People are risk-seeking in the loss domain and risk-averse in the gain domain.
People subjectively interpret probabilities.
When eliciting utility information from decision makers (either formally or informally), it is important to put the interviewee at ease and appreciate the challenge of uncovering latent value models when a person is limited by the above issues. In particular, there are a number of techniques developed over the years to help reduce the stress of an interview, speed up the process itself, and provide for validation of the results. Typically interviews involve three rounds: 

Conversation around what the decision criteria might be (e.g., brainstorming, value-focused thinking, or value hierarchies) and results in a ranked list of attributes with their associated acceptance ranges.
Confirmation of the attributes and elicitation of their single attribute utility functions, usually via a lottery-based questionnaire (see de Neufville 1990, for example) and weights for the multi-attribute utility function.
Validation of the single and multi-attribute utility functions via a number of alternatives rank comparisons (i.e., decision maker ranks alternatives by judgment and is compared to rankings by utility functions) and consistency checks (e.g., re-elicitation of points within utility functions). A caution here is that utility theory is normative and not descriptive, and therefore unaided decision making is likely to diverge from the predictions of the theory. This means that “validation” is more of a conversation rather than a simple check that the utility approach comes to the same conclusion as the decision maker.

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>One of the biggest concerns when applying decision analysis is effectively managing the issue of multiple decision makers. Different decision makers might access a system on different attributes, or they might have a different preference hierarchy for the attributes. In either case, a different utility function for each of the stakeholders is required, and it is difficult to compare values across these different utility functions. Only by making certain value assumptions can a single aggregate utility metric be defined.

For example, preferences of people can be stack ranked from the most important to the least important, which allows you to aggregate utility using weighted preference. Keeney and Raiffa (1993) recommend using a “supra-decision maker” model, where one person creates a multi-attribute utility function whose single attribute utility functions are the multi-attribute utility functions of each decision maker. The weights for each decision maker are then subjectively determined by the supra-decision maker.

Economist Kenneth Arrow won the Nobel Prize partly for showing that no aggregation method exists without making someone dictator (i.e., imposing preferences on others); or, in other words, no consistent, equitable method for social choice exists (Arrow 1963). Scott and Antonosson (2000), however, propose that Arrow’s Theorem may not apply to engineering design, since it is not a “social choice problem.” Comparisons of strength of preference, coupled with questioning the necessity of equity for engineering design, may allow for the creation of aggregate decision maker functions for design.

It is often most useful to keep decision maker preferences separate, as this avoids potential imposition of preferences and running afoul of the issues above. Not aggregating the decision makers avoids the creation of intransitivity of the group preference, allowing the decision makers to resolve conflicts via negotiation (Fitzgerald and Ross 2014). In this way, the designers would avoid biasing the decision tools and instead highlight important tensions in the preferences and their consequences on the set of alternatives.

Intro to core concepts: Value is benefit at cost that a stakeholder cares about, addressing three concepts: 1) degree of satisfaction (i.e., benefit); 2) resources used (i.e., cost); 3) degree of importance (i.e., priority); using attributes as multiple decision criteria, cost versus benefit framing decision opportunities, exploring many potential alternatives in a tradespace.
Examples of multiple criteria decisions: Cell phone (user: UI, battery life, ruggedization, camera, screen quality, etc.; manufacturer: production cost, manufacturing time, availability of suppliers, changes to existing production facility, etc.)
Value-Focused Thinking and Value-Driven Design
Value- vs. alternative-focused thinking: Alternative-focused thinking identifies potential solutions for the problem up front and then compares alternatives to select the one that best solves the given problem. Value-focused thinking starts with the problem, trying to formulate in a more solution-neutral manner, identifying how to maximize the value derived from the system. Using (preferably solution-neutral) values as a focus, it encourages creative problem solving and opens the solution space.
Traceability and communication support: One of the key benefits of engaging with stakeholders early and using value-focused thinking is that it increases the likelihood of success at decision time.
Developing Value Models
Overview of value models: Design-value loop perspective, evaluative models as performance and cost models, and value models.
Alternative single and multi-attribute value models: Some examples of single attribute approaches are &quot;Net Present Value&quot; and &quot;Single Attribute Utility&quot;; examples of multi-attribute approaches are Lexicographic, Pugh, QFD-like, Modified Decision Matrix, and Multi-Attribute Utility (MAU).
Example application of value models: Buying a car had different rankings of four alternatives via Lexicographic, Pugh, QFD-like, Modified Decision Matrix, and Multi-Attribute Utility methods. Each method has a different level of effort required and different degree of confidence in its results. It is important to understand the advantages and limitations of each method before using them.
Operationalizing Value Models
Operationalizing value with attributes: An attribute is a decision maker-perceived metric of how well the decision maker’s perceived objective is met; a decision maker is a type of stakeholder who has influence or control over driving the needs and setting the goals for the system. 
Axioms of utility theory: Normative theories are useful even when known to be descriptively invalid, as they can be used prescriptively to help improve decision making if decision makers want the axioms to hold. The axioms of utility theory are: relative preference, transitivity, monotonicity, existence, and substitution.
Considerations for utility elicitation: Decision makers must have preference over the attributes, and the characteristics of the set include completeness, comprehensiveness, importance, measurability, non-redundancy, and independence. Human cognitive limitations lead to the recognition that only about five attributes can be considered simultaneously. Likewise, people tend to think about changes in levels to be loss-averse, risk-seeking in the loss domain, risk-averse in the gain domain, and tend to interpret probabilities subjectively. When interviewing people, it is important to put them at ease and frame questions in the proper context. Typically, utility information is elicited in three rounds: 1) identification of attributes and their rankings; 2) confirmation of attributes and elicitation of single-attribute utility functions and multi-attribute utility weights; 3) validation of the elicited information.
Considerations for multiple decision makers: Technically, it is unsound to aggregate utility across decision makers, since no absolute universal scale exists to convert across their individual scales. In hierarchical organizations, use of supra-decision makers may be possible, with subordinates’ multi-attribute utility (MAU) as attributes for the higher-level decision maker. The best practice is to keep decision maker utilities separate and leverage computational or negotiation-based techniques to find win-win solutions for all parties.
Value hierarchies: When there are more than 3-5 attributes, we can often simplify the problem via decomposition and abstraction using a hierarchy. Parents are decomposed into children, with no more than 3-5 children for a given parent. Weights can be assigned to each node (locally) and via aggregation functions, and global weights can be determined. When all children independently contribute value, linear weighted sums can be used, and all weights for children of a given parent must add up to one.
